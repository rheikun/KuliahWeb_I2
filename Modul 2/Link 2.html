            Abandoned by her parents, Shiro is an 11-year-old shut-in gamer who, along with her step-brother, Sora, form 『No Game No Life』(Blank/Kuhaku). <br>
            Sora's dad married Shiro's mother, both having remarried, thus making Shiro and Sora step-siblings.

        Shiro is described as a genius in logic and problems but has difficulty understanding emotions or behavior, relying on Sora to help her defeat beings with emotions such as Tet 
        in their chess match. She also rarely shows much emotion at all and, despite her genius intellect, speaks in short, terse sentences and in a third-person perspective.
        Shiro is a master of Chess and has won every chess game that she has played. She can speak 18 languages and learns Immanity's language in under 15 minutes (while Sora required an hour). She is also excellent with games and, along with her brother, is the best in more than 280 games.
        She is shown to have a dry and somewhat twisted sense of humor,displaying signs of jealousy if Sora pays serious attention to other girls, showing she has a brother complex.
        She is also shown to be very sarcastic when it comes to Stephanie, although she calls her "just a friend". She is also not above teasing Sora about his mildly perverse tendencies.
        Shiro is extremely close to her brother, to the point of requiring him to be by her side in order to function correctly. If Shiro is separated from Sora by so much as a closed door,
        she becomes almost catatonic until he returns to her. This can generate problems as when Shiro bathes; she does not want Sora to see her naked yet she can't be separated from him far enough to not be seen. This can be resolved with the presence of steam to cloud their view enough. However, Shiro also generally dislikes bathing as it stiffens her hair, although this was
        resolved by the Spiritwater Blend Shampoo from Jibril.
        She is shown to be a little bit rough and competitive when it comes to games and tends to show-off for any reason possible for the game.
        Shiro also has a slightly sadistic side to her, which she usually keeps hidden. This is shown evident when she forces Plum to lick the sweat off her feet in order for him to regain
        energy. Although Plum does not think too badly of it, Sora still can't help but be shocked every time he sees his sister act that way.

        <h4>Powers and Abilities:</h4>
        <li> Genius Intelligence,</li> 
        <li> Reflexes,</li> 
        <li> Expert Marksmanship,</li> 
        <li> Masterful Analytical skills,</li> 
        <li> Can calculate and predict an AI-controlled opponent's behavior, </li>
        <li> Perfect Memory, </li>
        <li> Master Strategist</li>
        
        <h4>Strengths : </h4>
        <li>Extreme Intellect: Shiro is shown to be a genius multiple times throughout the series, surpassing even a supercomputer[citation needed]. She possesses an eidetic memory and is able to recall a vast amount of information quickly and accurately. She claims that chess is merely a tic-tac-toe game and was able to learn Immanity-Go in 15 minutes. According to Sora, she speaks 18 languages fluently and is able to predict movements and the bullet trajectories of her opponents. She is even able to figure out the mathematics behind the NPC's movements in Love or Loved 2 and was able to successfully win with that info.</li>
        
        <h4>Weaknesses : </h4>
        <li>Unpredictability: When playing against a sentient being, Shiro can be thrown off and that is where Sora will have to play for her as shown in their chess game against Tet. When Izuna activated her Blood Destruction, Shiro proclaimed that she was too unpredictable and she won't be able to shoot her as she is. she said she could not play against Chlammy in chess when her pieces won't sacrifice.</li>
        <li>Sora: When Shiro and Sora are apart for even a moment, they are reduced to a state of fright and often call each other's names and apologize for everything they've ever done. In the No Game No Life Desu manga, Sora and Shiro facetime each other when they're forced to be separated from each other even if they're just a few feet away. Also in the No Game No Life episodes when Sora was playing Othello Shiro could not say their team moto. "Blank never lose".</li>
